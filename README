To get started, you need to checkout both jchemhub and the google closure library, 
which jchemhub expects to find in a directory named 'third-party' adjacent to the
jchemhub directory.

	After you cd to your workspace:

	For read-only (change the URL for read-write):
	git clone git://github.com/chemhack/jchemhub.git
	
	mkdir third-party
	
	cd third-party
	
	svn checkout http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/closure/ closure

If you make and edit that changes a goog.provide or goog.require statement, 
execute the calcdeps.py python script as follows to re-generate deps.js:

	cd third-party/closure/goog/
	../bin/calcdeps.py -o deps -p ../../../jchemhub -p ../../closure > ../../../jchemhub/deps.js
