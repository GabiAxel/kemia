To get started, you need to checkout both jchemhub and the google closure library, 
which jchemhub expects to find in a directory named 'third-party' adjacent to the
jchemhub directory.

	After you cd to your workspace:

	For read-only (replace the URL for read-write access):
	git clone git://github.com/chemhack/jchemhub.git
	
	mkdir third-party
	
	cd third-party
	
	svn checkout http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/closure/ closure

If you make an edit that changes a goog.provide or goog.require statement, 
execute the calcdeps.py python script as follows to re-generate deps.js:

	cd third-party/closure/goog/
	
	python ../bin/calcdeps.py -o deps -p ../../../jchemhub -p ../../closure > ../../../jchemhub/deps.js 

The foregoing is sufficient to edit and run the code, but it is also a good idea to use the closure compiler as follows described below. 

Create a directory for the compiler to live in, then retrieve and unpack it (the example below assumes that is it in a directory named 'closure-compiler' 
adjacent to the jchemhub directory:
	
	mkdir closure-compiler
	
	cd closure-compiler
	
	wget http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip
	
	unzip compiler-latest.zip
	
	rm compiler-latest.zip
	
Not that the compiler.jar file can go into any convenient location, just adjust the --compiler_jar argument below accordingly

Execute the compiler with a command like:
	
	cd third-party/closure/goog/
	
	python ../bin/calcdeps.py -o compiled -p ../../closure -p ../../../jchemhub --compiler_jar ../../../closure-compiler/compiler.jar --input ../../../jchemhub/controller/controller.js > ../../../controller_compiled.js
