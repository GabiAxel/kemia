To get started, you need to checkout jchemhub:

	After you cd to your workspace:

	For read-only (replace the URL for read-write access):
	git clone git://github.com/chemhack/jchemhub.git

	cd jchemhub

This will pull in the google closure library:

	git submodule init

	git submodule update
	

If you make an edit that changes a goog.provide or goog.require statement, 
execute the calcdeps.py python script as follows to re-generate deps.js:

	cd third-party/closure/closure/goog/
	
	python ../bin/calcdeps.py -o deps -p ../../../../jchemhub/ -p ../../closure/ > ../../../../jchemhub/deps.js 


The foregoing is sufficient to edit and run the code, but it is also a good idea to use the closure compiler as follows described below. 

Create a directory for the compiler to live in, then retrieve and unpack it (the example below assumes that is it in a directory named 'closure-compiler' 
adjacent to the jchemhub directory:
	
	mkdir closure-compiler
	
	cd closure-compiler
	
	wget http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip
	
	unzip compiler-latest.zip
	
	rm compiler-latest.zip
	
Not that the compiler.jar file can go into any convenient location, just adjust the --compiler_jar argument below accordingly

Execute the compiler with a command like:
	
	cd third-party/closure/closure/goog/
	
	python ../bin/calcdeps.py -o compiled -p ../../closure -p ../../../../jchemhub --compiler_jar ../../../../../closure-compiler/compiler.jar --input ../../../../jchemhub/controller/controller.js > ../../../../../jchemhub_compiled.js
